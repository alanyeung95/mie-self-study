```
car a and car b collide, after collusion, both vehicles have their brakes locked, car a slide backward 4 meter, car b slide forward 1 meter

m_a = m_b = 1.85 kg
v_a = 9km/hour before collision
Î¼_k = 0.3 for both cars

Find:
1) The speed of vehicle A immediately after
collision;
2) The speed of vehicle B immediately after
collision;
3) The speed of vehicle B just before the
collision.
