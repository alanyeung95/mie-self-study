# Forces I

```
W = mg
```

For all masses near the earth’s surface, the earth exerts a downward gravitational force
which is known as the weight of the mass and has a magnitude given by

# Friction

F_f = μ \* F_N

# Linear Momentum and Collisions

## Viscosity

Viscosity = μ (mu)

Viscosity is the resistance of a fluid (liquid or gas) to a change in shape or movement of neighbouring portions relative to one another. Viscosity denotes opposition to flow.

## formula

### kinetic energy

T1 = 1/2m(v')^2

### work-energy theorem

```
U_1-2 = F x d

F = friction
d = distance
```

is used to calculate the work done by friction (F) over a distance (d) when an object moves from point 1 to point 2. This work is equal to the change in the object's kinetic energy between the two points.

### change in potential energy

```
ΔU = mgh
```

where ΔU is the change in potential energy, m is the mass of the object, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is the change in height.

### friction

```
𝐹𝑓 = 𝞵𝑘𝑚𝐴𝑔
```

### magnitude momentum

```
sqrt(p_x^2 + p_y^2)
```

### linear impulse

```
J = FΔt
```

where J is the linear impulse, F is the force applied, and Δt is the time interval during which the force acts.

### change of mementum

```
Δp = pfinal - pinitial
```

### elastic collision

```
m1v1i + m2v2i = m1v1f + m2v2f
```

where:
m1 = mass of object 1
m2 = mass of object 2
v1i = initial velocity of object 1
v2i = initial velocity of object 2
v1f = final velocity of object 1
v2f = final velocity of object 2

### center of mass

```
xCM = (m1x1 + m2x2) / (m1 + m2)
```
